<h1>When You Are Old</h1>
<p>When you are old and grey and full of sleep,<br>
And nodding by the fire, take down this book,<br>
And slowly read, and dream of the soft look<br>
Your eyes had once, and of their shadows deep;</p>
<p>How many loved your moments of glad grace,<br>
And loved your beauty with love false or true,<br>
But one man loved the pilgrim soul in you,<br>
And loved the sorrows of your changing face;</p>
<p>And bending down beside the glowing bars,<br>
Murmur, a little sadly, how Love fled<br>
And paced upon the mountains overhead<br>
And hid his face amid a crowd of stars.</p>
<p>â€”William Butler Yeats</p>
